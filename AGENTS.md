## CRITICAL: Git operations

- **ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN**: **NEVER** run `git restore`, `git checkout`, `git reset`, `git clean`, `git rm`, or any other git commands that modify or discard working directory changes **WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION**
- **DATA LOSS RISK**: These commands can **PERMANENTLY LOSE CODE CHANGES** and cannot be easily recovered
- **REQUIRED ACTION**: If you need to revert or discard changes, **YOU MUST ASK THE USER FIRST**
- If the worktree contains unexpected edits, read them and work around them; do not revert them
- The commit message **MUST ONLY BE RELATED TO THE CHANGES**, not to the prompt
- **ALWAYS** include a body in commit message to summarize the changes. Use the template below **IMPORTANT**:

```txt
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

Summary:
- Changes 1
- Changes 2
- ...
- Changes N
```
